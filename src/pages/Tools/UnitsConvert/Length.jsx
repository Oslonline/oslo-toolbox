          <p className="text-gray-700">
            - <strong>Kilometre (km):</strong> The metric unit of length equal to 1,000 meters. Commonly used for measuring larger distances.
            <br />- <strong>Metre (m):</strong> The base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). Used globally for most length measurements.
            <br />- <strong>Centimetre (cm):</strong> A metric unit of length equal to 0.01 meters. Used for smaller measurements.
            <br />- <strong>Millimetre (mm):</strong> A metric unit of length equal to 0.001 meters. Used for very small measurements.
            <br />- <strong>Micrometre (Âµm):</strong> A metric unit of length equal to 0.000001 meters. Used in scientific measurements.
            <br />- <strong>Nanometre (nm):</strong> A metric unit of length equal to 0.000000001 meters. Used in nanotechnology.
            <br />- <strong>Nautical mile:</strong> A unit of length used in maritime and air navigation, equal to 1,852 meters.
            <br />- <strong>Mile:</strong> A unit of length used primarily in the United States and the UK, equal to 1,609 meters.
