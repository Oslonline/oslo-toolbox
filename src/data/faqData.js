        question: "Is it safe to use the same hash function for all my data?",
        answer: "While you can use the same hash function, it's crucial to use a salt (a random value added to the input) to enhance security, especially when hashing passwords. Salting prevents attackers from using precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is a cryptographic salt?",
        answer: "A cryptographic salt is a random value added to the input of a hash function to ensure that the same input will produce different hash values. This enhances security by preventing attackers from using precomputed hash tables to crack passwords.",
